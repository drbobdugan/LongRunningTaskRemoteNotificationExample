# A very basic python-based Apple Push Notification server that uses the PyAPNS framework:

#
# Listener for feedback from Apple's gateway server
#
def response_listener(error_response):
    print 'client get error-response: {}'.format( str(error_response))

#
# Main Program
#

# Get APNs data structure.  You will need to create your own ...Cert.pem and ...Key.pem files and
# locate them in the same directory as this program.  This is an involved process that will require 
# you to:
#   - create a certificate signing request using OSX's Keychain Access tool
#   - create a new app via the iOS Developer Center
#   - create a development SSL certificate for app via the iOS Developer Center
#   - download the development SSL certificate to your OSX machine
#   - create an SSL certificate .pem file via openssl and the SSL certificate you download on
#     your OSX machine (this is the ...Cert.pem file you need below)
#   - create a private key .pem file via the certificate signing request, and .pem SSL 
#     certificate (this is the ...Key.pem file you need below)
